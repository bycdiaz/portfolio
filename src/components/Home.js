          I'm Carlos. I'm a self-taught web developer. I started learning in 
          late 2018 with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin 
          Project</a>. I've found joy in coding in a lot of ways. Making
          stuff is cool. Helping new learners in The Odin Project community
          has also been rewarding. I also find that I enjoy solving problems
          in the context of larger projects and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/bycdiaz">

          I grew up in Los Angeles, California and currently live in Philly, PA.
          Presently, I'm an academic advisor for an undergraduate engineering
          major. I have formal training as a Salsa dancer and spent several years
          teaching and performing. I'm also currently attempting to get myself
          back to conversational in Russian.
